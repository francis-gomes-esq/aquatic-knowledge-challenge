## Description

Dive into the fascinating world of marine biology with the Aquatic Knowledge Challenge Quiz.

This project provided a hands-on opportunity to reinforce my web development skills. The incorporation of instant feedback, visual enhancements, and diverse difficulty levels expanded my knowledge of creating engaging and educational quiz applications. I delved into timer animations, sound effects, and accessibility considerations to ensure an inclusive experience for all users.
